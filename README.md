# LIRTS-Viewer

## Welcome to the Lens Injury Response Time Series (LIRTS) Viewer which is a resource for visualization of gene expression changes during lens injury response induced after cataract surgery.

### The initial framework of the resource was developed in collaboration with the University of Delaware Computer Science Senior Capstone Design Team. The resource is now hosted via the University of Delaware computational cluster Biomix.

Web Hosting
Node Package Manager (NPM) version 8.19.4 (node version 16.20.1) was utilized to build a compilation folder by running the default command
> npm run build
The resulting build folder with the compiled files and images was launched using an Apache server hosted on Biomix, a high-performance computing cluster at the University of Delaware, at the URL https://lirts.dbi.udel.edu/.
